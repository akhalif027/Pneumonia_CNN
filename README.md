# Pneumonia_CNN
Diagnosing patients with pneumonia solely based on X-ray images using a convulutional neural network (CNN). Databases orginated from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.




##Objective

This experiment aims to determine whether machine learning can differentiate the differences between normal patients and patients whose lungs have been infected with pneumonia with high accuracy. If successful, diagnosing early cases of pneumonia may become faster and more efficient.

The main differentiation between these lungs is that pneumonia-infected lungs contain Lobar consolidation which means they contain fluid such as blood in airspaces that limit respiration. It is diagnosed by using an X-ray to identify a blob of a darker shade not visible in normal lungs. Lobar consolidation can occur in any part of the lungs causing a diagnosis to become more complicated than other diseases.1
